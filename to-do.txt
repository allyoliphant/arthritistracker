List of current and future work I want to complete


Bugs:
* In mobile, footer is too far down on account page
* In mobile, if navigation is open and changes to non-mobile (navigation moves from the top to the side), the menu remains open
* favicon not displaying

Features:
* In entry history, change count of entries per joint to a bar graph
* In entry history, hovering/clicking on counts opens a popup of details (joint, time, etc) of all the entries part of the count
* In entry history, can move from year to month and month to day by clicking on month/day on the x-axis
* In entry history, don't include the time range (y-axis) in the scrollable part of the table
* In new entry, date and time are taken from the user's current location, instead of the timezone being hardcoded
  (?) let the user enter a location/timezone, especially if one can't be automatically found for the user
  (?) or just have a default timezone that will be used if none can be found
* Change login page to a popup
* Persistent login
* Add possible causes tracking (weather, diet, exercise, etc)
* Make the website into an app
    - allow for use without the need for internet
